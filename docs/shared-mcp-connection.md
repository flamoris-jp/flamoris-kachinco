# Shared desktop MCP connection

This app consumes the published `Flamoris.Mcp.Core` and `Flamoris.Mcp.Wpf` 1.4.0
through ordinary NuGet restore. No Core source checkout, custom feed or
`FlamorisMcpSourceRoot` override is required. See [startup and independent consent](mcp-startup.md).

MCP / AI contains only Connect..., Stop, Settings... in the current UI language.
Manual Connect confirms the selected method and previous permission. Settings
owns method, permission, auto-connect and secure credentials. New preferences enable
local read-only Manual auto-connect at application startup; saved OFF remains OFF.
Saving changes prompts to reconnect; declining leaves the current live permission
unchanged. New settings apply on the next connection. There is no cursor override.

One bottom-right red/green icon means disconnected/connected. Chipsy appears at
window center for 500 ms after actual connection or successful AI state changes,
48 DIP (roughly twice Cutwork's tool glyph), without intercepting input. Reads,
health/status, failed calls and validation errors do not trigger it.

Manual and OpenAI tunnel-client keep the same-user local bridge. Hub uses outbound
WSS with a per-upstream credential in Windows Credential Manager. The host's current
session, revision guards, permission checks and Undo/Redo remain authoritative.
The application-lifetime grant survives document open/close/replacement, including
reopening the same file. Each target gets a fresh document token; stale guards and
pending results cannot follow it. `mcp.context` and discovery work without a file;
document tools return `no_document`. Stop suppresses reconnect until an explicit
connection; auto-connect waits for the application runtime, not an open document.

## Windows acceptance

- Confirm the identical three-item menu and settings in Japanese and English.
- With a fresh settings profile, startup enables the local read-only Manual endpoint
  before opening a file. Green requires an authenticated/registered client; a waiting
  local endpoint alone is not green. Verify context/discovery and `no_document`.
- Cancel connection: no new grant. Confirm read-only: no edits permitted.
- Save Edit permission while connected, decline reconnect: current grant stays
  read-only. Accept reconnect: old grant rejected, new grant can edit.
- Auto-connect ON restores the saved permission after restart; OFF does not.
- Manual and tunnel connect through the packaged bridge; Hub registers to the
  configured WSS endpoint. No desktop LAN listener is created.
- Only connection and successful edits show centered Chipsy; verify actual scale
  and timing by eye. Queries, errors and cancellation must not show it.
- Verify only the bottom-right indicator remains, and the mouse cursor is unchanged.
- Stop, permission changes and exit revoke the previous grant. Document replacement
  keeps the transport, changes the target token and rejects old guards/results.
  Hub loss leaves manual editing and history intact and never replays a mutation.

The generic provider regression tests now live in MCP Core. Packaged app smoke tests
still exercise the application-owned tools/history through the shared connection UI.

Issue #76 adds four Edit-only media upload tools (ADR 0018). After updating the
desktop, add those reviewed entries to the existing Hub catalog and preserve
the other editing tools and credentials. Stop, document replacement and disconnect
discard unfinished transfers. Successful imports use the shared native history and
their durable files remain available for Undo/Redo and saved-project reopen.


The Issue #72 image query requires matching current Core/Wpf 1.4.0 desktop
**and bridge** binaries.
After updating, copy Hub registration configuration again and replace the existing
Kachinco catalog's tools with the reviewed generated catalog (including
preview_frame). Preserve endpoint, connector token, other upstreams and existing
permissions; a new tool in desktop discovery alone does not update static Hub YAML.
See staging/windows-issue72.md for the actual external image acceptance checklist.
